## About
This respository is the fulfillment of a class project at the University of British Columbia. The course is [COGS 300](https://cogsys.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2016/01/COGS-300-syllabus-3-3.pdf) in the Cognitive Systems program at the university. The course studies the design and development, both natural and artificial, of cognitive systems.

## Project
This simulation is an example of [self-organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organization) (also called "spontaneous order"), a principle of cogntive and social sciences. The phenomenon is defined by the appearance of higher-order patterns emerging as the product of lower-order interactions between agents. In this example, dots of different colors spawn on a canvas in random positions. All the dots are drawn towards a central "attractor," but are repelled by dots of a different color. Over time, the dots find themselves sorted by color, even though no higher-order logic directed the sorting.

## Use
The project is available on [Github Pages](https://wzich.github.io/population-sorting-simulation/). The experience is designed for desktop. You can select different population sizes and adjust variables such as attractor strength and repellence. Watch as the dots sort themselves into neighborhoods!

## Authors
Research for this project was conducted in a group of students: Heather McFadyen, Darian Ngo, and Will Zich.
The simulation was created by Will Zich.
